# Agentic AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Agentic AI workflows** built using structured multi-agent architectures. These projects explore how **LLM planning, tool usage, reflection loops, evaluation feedback, and continuous improvement** can be designed in real-world automated systems.

---

## Project Philosophy

Agentic AI goes beyond simple prompt-based responses. These projects follow a **systematic agent design workflow**:

Stage | Purpose
----- | --------
Initial Planning & Task Decomposition | Break down a user problem into logical steps
Reflective Design | Think before acting ‚Äì evaluate steps and plan improvements
Tool Use (Functions & External APIs) | Use tools such as databases, file systems, web search, and compute functions
Evals & Error Analysis | Use feedback from LLM self-evaluation and/or external evaluators
Iterative Refinement | Improve responses using refinement loops
Impact Measurement | Show how structured planning improves output quality and reliability

## Project Index

S.No | Project Name | Description | Key Concepts
---- | -------------|-------------|--------------
1 | Interactive Chart Generator | Generates visual insights from CSV files and refines based on feedback | File Parsing, Visualization, Reflection
2 | SQL Query Generation Agent | Validates SQL queries from DB schemas with reflection loops | DB Tools, Planning
3 | Tool Toggle Agent | Chooses and toggles tools based on task goals | Decision Routing
4 | Content Writing Agentic AI | Generates and refines content using constructive feedback | Reflection, Evals
5 | Research Agentic AI | Researches topics using external tools and citation refinement | Web Tools, Self-Correction
6 | Startup Builder | Analyses and idea communicates with 6 different agents and gives the market analysis, gap analysis, gap, scope, mvp features | Multi-Agent Workflow
7 | Portfolio Generator | Analyzes the resume, parses it, generates a portfolio website based on it | Resume Parsing, Website Generation
8 | Stock Data Visualizer | Retreives Stock information using Yahoo finance and plots a graph based on the data. Refines the charts. Uses 5 different agents | Stock Data, Visualization, Reflection
