# Agentic AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Agentic AI workflows** built using structured multi-agent architectures. These projects explore how **LLM planning, tool usage, reflection loops, evaluation feedback, and continuous improvement** can be designed in real-world automated systems.

## Project Philosophy

Agentic AI goes beyond simple prompt-based responses. These projects follow a **systematic agent design workflow**:

Stage | Purpose
----- | --------
Initial Planning & Task Decomposition | Break down a user problem into logical steps
Reflective Design | Think before acting â€“ evaluate steps and plan improvements
Tool Use (Functions & External APIs) | Use tools such as databases, file systems, web search, and compute functions
Evals & Error Analysis | Use feedback from LLM self-evaluation and/or external evaluators
Iterative Refinement | Improve responses using refinement loops
Impact Measurement | Show how structured planning improves output quality and reliability
